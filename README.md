# Solidworks Equations README

This VSCode extension offers convenience features when working with Dassault Solidworks' equations. It offers syntax highlighting, linting and on-the-fly evaluation variables and smart dimensions.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

- **Variables**: Easily distinguish variables within your SolidWorks equations and scripts.
- **Units**: Quickly identify units to ensure they are correctly applied to variables and equations.
- **Dimensions**: Enhance the readability of dimensions in sketches, making it easier to work with complex designs.

### Linting

- **Undefined Variables Detection**: Automatically detect and highlight the usage of undefined variables, helping to reduce errors in your equations and scripts. Linting is done by an LSP backend, through building a full variable dependency graph.

### Navigation

- **Equations evaluation**: Variables and smart dimensions defined through equations are automatically evaluated and structured on a covenient side panel, assorted by sketch. Clicking on a variable jumps to the relevant equation defining it.

- **Jump to Variable Definition**: Effortlessly navigate to the definition of variables within your project, improving your efficiency in managing and updating equations.

## Scope

Extension is preset to work with .eqn and .txt file extensions

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "SolidWorks" or "Solidworks equations" in the Extensions marketplace search bar.
4. Click on the Install button to install the extension.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension automatically activates the following features when you open a SolidWorks equations file or script:

- Syntax highlighting activates based on the file content, with no additional setup required.
- Linting and variables and measurements evaluation runs automatically on file being opened or changes being made.
- To use the "Jump to Variable Definition" feature, simply hover over a variable and right-click, then select "Go to Definition" from the context menu.
